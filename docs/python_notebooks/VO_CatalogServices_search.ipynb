        "     Table presents the X-ray properties of all 1121 objects, including fluxes in six selected energy bands, and public available optical data for X-ray counterparts. X-ray flux in X/O flux ratio is the sum of fluxes in (0.5-2keV) and (2-4.5keV) bands, while the optical flux corresponds to R band. The represented hardness ratio was set using the same X-ray bands. Photometric redshifts and K-corrections were measured using the photometric information in five optical (Furusawa et al., 2008, Cat. J/ApJS/176/1), three NIR (Hewett et al., 2006MNRAS.367..454H; Hodgkin et al., 2009MNRAS.394..675H), and four MIR IRAC (SWIRE survey) bands. Morphological classification was obtained using the galSVM code (Huertas-Company et al., 2008A&amp;A...478..971H, 2009A&amp;A...497..743H), one of the new methods useful especially when dealing with high-redshift sources and low-resolution data. With galSVM we obtained the mean surface brightness, asymmetry, concentration index, Gini, Smoothness, M20 moment of light, and two probabilities p1 and p2 that the galaxy belongs to early- (E, S0, S0/Sa) or late-type, respectively. Stellarity and elongation parameters were obtained with SExtractor. All objects with stellarity parameter greater or equal to 0.9 were considered as compact in this work. We included in our analysis for early-type objects only those sources with p1 probabilities greater or equal to 0.75, and for late-type objects all sources with probabilities p2 greater than 0.5.\n",

        "     The XMM-Newton Hard Bright Serendipitous Survey (HBSS) is part of a bigger survey project known as XMM Bright Serendipitous Survey (XBS). This latter consists of two flux-limited serendipitous samples of X-ray selected sources at high galactic latitude (|b|&gt;20deg): the XMM BSS sample (389 sources) and the XMM HBSS sample (67 sources, with 56 sources in common with the BSS sample) having an EPIC MOS2 count rate limit, corrected for vignetting, of 10^-2^cts/s (2x10^-3^cts/s) in the 0.5-4.5keV (4.5-7.5keV) energy band; the flux limit is ~7x10^-14^cgs in both energy selection bands. At the time of this writing the spectroscopic identification rate is 87% for the BSS sample and 97% for the HBSS sample. The details on the XMM-Newton fields selection strategy and the source selection criteria of the XMM BSS and HBSS samples are discussed in Della Ceca et al. (2004, Cat. &lt;J/A+A/428/383&gt;), while a description of the optical data and analysis, of the optical classification scheme, and of the optical properties of the extragalactic sources identified so far, is presented in Caccianiga et al. (2008A&amp;A...477..735C). The optical and X-ray properties of the galactic population are discussed in Lopez-Santiago et al. (2007A&amp;A...463..165L).The current classification breakdown of the HBSS sample is as follows: 62 AGN, 1 cluster of galaxies (XBSJ 141830.5+251052), and 2 X-ray emitting stars (XBSJ 014100.6-675328 and XBSJ 123600.7-395217). Two X-ray sources (XBSJ080411.3+650906 and XBSJ 110050.6-344331) are still unidentified at the time of this writing.

An overall comparison of the survey results with those of previous surveys confirms the ubiquity of X-ray emission in the Pleiades cluster stars and its higher rate of emission with respect to older stars. It is found that the X-ray emission from dA and early dF stars cannot be proven to be dissimilar to that of Hyades and field stars of the same spectral type. The Pleiades cluster members show a real rise of the X-ray luminosity from dA stars to early dF stars.

Spectral information from the survey data could be obtained for 59 Seyfert 1 galaxies and only for one Seyfert 2 galaxy. The tables quote the name of the Seyfert galaxy in column 1 and the ROSAT name in column 2. Columns 3 and 4 contain the ROSAT position. We mostly give the centroid source position from the pointed observation with the higher exposure times. The columns 5 and 6 list the count rates, columns 7 and 8 the corresponding exposure times, columns 9 and 10 the fluxes and columns 11 and 12 the luminosities of the sources detected in ROSAT pointing and survey observations, respectively. The survey count rates were taken from the RASS II catalogue and the pointing count rates were computed from the light curves of the sources. The labels \"(p)\" and \"(h)\" in column 5 indicate that the source data are taken from a PSPC or HRI observation. In the columns 9 and 10 we apply the labels \"(f)\" and \"(c)\" to mark the data produced by spectral fit or by count rates. This specification applies also for columns 11 and 12. The Galactic column density is given in column 13 (Dickey &amp; Lockman, 1990ARA&amp;A..28..215D), while the column density obtained from the spectral fit is given in column 14. The other spectral fit parameters, namely the monochromatic flux at 1keV and the photon index are also given in columns 15 and 16, respectively. The value \"-2.3\" of the photon index was used, if no reliable spectral fit could be obtained. When spectral information was available from the survey as well as from the pointed data, we quote the results from the pointed observations. Columns 17 and 18 show the quality of the X-ray identifications both in the pointing and the survey observations, the identifications labeled either with 1 or 2, 1 and 2 indicating high and lower degree of reliability, respectively. In the last column we have listed the classification of the Seyfert type (Sy1.0, Sy1.2, Sy1.5, Sy1.8, Sy1.9, Sy2.0) taken from the \"Catalogue of Seyfert Galaxies\" (Lipovetski et al., 1987, Cat. &lt;VII/173&gt;). We have modified the Rafanelli et al. conventions (S1 = Sy1.0 + Sy1.2 + Sy1.5 and S2 = Sy1.8 + Sy1.9 + Sy2.0) to S1 = Sy1.0 + Sy1.2 + Sy1.5 + Sy1.8 + Sy1.9 and S2 = S2.0.

For each source of the Rafanelli sample we have searched for X-ray detections within the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS II catalogue; see Voges, Aschenbach, Boller et al., 1999, Cat. &lt;IX/10&gt; for references) and public PSPC (Position Sensitive Proportional Counter) and HRI (High Resolution Imager) pointed observations. The sources have been identified on X-ray contour maps overlaid to optical images taken from the Palomar Digitized Sky Survey (DSS).

        "* RIXOS source sample X-ray spectra (Mittaz+, 1999)\n",
        "     We present results of an extensive study of the X-ray spectral properties of sources detected in the RIXOS survey, which is a large, nearly complete sample of objects detected serendipitously in ROSAT PSPC fields down to a flux limit of 3x10^-14^erg/cm2/s (0.5-2keV). We show that for X-ray surveys containing sources with low count rate, such as RIXOS, spectral slopes estimated using simple hardness ratios in the ROSAT band can be biased. Instead, we analyse three-colour X-ray data using statistical techniques appropriate to the Poisson regime which remove the effects of this bias. We also show that the use of three-colour data enables some discrimination between thermal and non-thermal spectra. We have then applied this technique to the RIXOS survey to study the spectral properties of the sample. For the AGN we find an average energy index of 1.05+/-0.05, with no evidence for spectral evolution with redshift. Individual AGN are shown to have a range of properties, including soft X-ray excesses and intrinsic absorption. Narrow-emission-line galaxies (NLLGs) also seem to fit to a power-law spectrum, which may indicate a non-thermal origin for their X-ray emission. We infer that most of the clusters in the sample have a bremsstrahlung temperature &gt;3keV, although some show evidence for a cooling flow. The stars deviate strongly from a power-law model but fit to a thermal model. Finally, we have analysed the whole RIXOS sample (extending the flux cut-off to the sensitivity threshold of each individual observation) containing 1762 sources to study the relationship between spectral slope and flux. We find that the mean spectral slope of the sources hardens at lower fluxes, in agreement with results from other samples. However, a study of the individual sources demonstrates that the majority have relatively soft spectra even at faint flux levels, and the hardening of the mean is caused by the appearance of a population of very hard sources at the lowest fluxes. This has implications for the nature of the soft X-ray background.\n",

The relationship between {alpha}_xox_ and {alpha}_{gamma}x{gamma}_ reveals that flat spectrum radio quasars and low-energy peaked BL Lacertae follow a continuous trend, which is consistent with previous results, whereas high-energy peaked BL Lacertae follow a separate distinct trend. Even so, a unified scheme is also revealed from {alpha}_xox_-{alpha}_{gamma}x{gamma}_ diagram when all three subclasses of blazars are considered.\n",

Our sample of 135 sources only includes those that have more than 100 net counts in the 0.3-10keV energy band and have been identified through optical spectroscopy. The majority of the sources are well described by a simple power-law model with either no absorption (76%) or a significant intrinsic, absorbing column (20%). The remaining ~4% of the sources require a more complex modeling by incorporating additional components to the power law. For sources with more than 180 net counts (bright sample), we allowed both the photon spectral index Gamma and the equivalent hydrogen column NH to be free parameters. For fainter sources, we fix Gamma to the average value and allow NH to vary. The mean spectral index of the 82 sources in the bright sample is &lt;Gamma&gt;=2.06+/-0.08, with an intrinsic dispersion of ~0.24. Each of these sources has fractional errors on the value of Gamma below 20%. As expected, the distribution of intrinsic absorbing column densities is markedly different between AGNs with or without broad optical emission lines. We find within our sample four type 2 QSO candidates (L_X_&gt;10^44^erg/s, NH&gt;10^22^cm^-2^), with a spectral energy distribution well reproduced by a composite Seyfert 2 spectrum, that demonstrates the strength of the wide-field COSMOS XMM-Newton survey to detect these rare and underrepresented sources. In addition, we have identified a Compton-thick (NH&gt;1.5x10^24^cm^-2^) AGN at z=0.1248. Its X-ray spectrum is well fitted by a pure reflection model and a significant Fe K{alpha} line at rest-frame energy of 6.4keV.\n",
